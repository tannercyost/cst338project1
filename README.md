# CST 338 Project 1
This was a project I created for CST 338 in Fall 2018.
# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use Java classes to create many distinct objects that work together. To illustrate this, we were introduced to the idea of UML diagrams and were tasked with creating one for this project.
# Testing
This project was created before I was proficient with unit-testing, so I created my own test files. That is what all of the T[X].java files are.
